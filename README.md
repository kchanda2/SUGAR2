# SUGAR2: Simulation with Unity and Gazebo for Augmented Reality and Robots

SUGAR2 is a novel hybrid simulation platform that for the first time supports the simultaneous simulation of human-multi-robot behaviors and their AR-based interactions.

The figures shows the Gazebo environment with the workbench (left), and the three Turtlebot2 robots waiting outside the room (right).
